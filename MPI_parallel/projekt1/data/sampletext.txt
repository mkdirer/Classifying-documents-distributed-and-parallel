The fruit salad that I made for the party was a hit! It had a variety of colorful fruits like apple, orange, banana, pineapple, and mango. Everyone loved the sweetness of the fruits and how well they complemented each other. I made sure to cut the apple into small cubes, so it wouldn't overpower the other fruits. The orange added a citrusy tang to the salad, while the banana gave it a creamy texture. The pineapple brought a tropical twist to the dish, and the mango added a bright and exotic flavor. I was happy to see that the fruit salad was the first dish to finish on the table!
