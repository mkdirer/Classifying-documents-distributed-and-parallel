Yesterday, I went to the grocery store to buy some fruits for the week. I picked up an apple, a banana, and an orange, but unfortunately, they were out of pineapples and mangoes. As I walked down the aisle, I noticed a recipe for a pineapple and mango salsa on a flyer. I decided to give it a try and bought the ingredients. The recipe called for diced pineapple and mango, mixed with red onion, cilantro, and lime juice. It sounded delicious, and I couldn't wait to try it out. I quickly made the salsa when I got home, and it was the perfect addition to my grilled chicken dinner. The sweetness of the pineapple and mango, combined with the tanginess of the lime juice, complemented the chicken perfectly. I'll definitely make it again once the store restocks on pineapples and mangoes!
